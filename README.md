Implemented inheritance and polymorphism to create a cohesive hierarchy of animal subclasses, inheriting shared behaviors and characteristics from the abstract Animal class. Effectively applied encapsulation to ensure controlled access to data. Leveraged interfaces (such as Serializable, Cloneable, and Comparable) to enhance the functionality and adaptability of the Animal class and its subclasses. Additionally, incorporated essential I/O functionality and demonstrated proficient exception handling.
